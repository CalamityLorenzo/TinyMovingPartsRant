# Breathe Tiny Moving parts
The record is excellent, the band is on form. They are certainly one of my favourite bands of the past 10 years.
This record is heading towards the new Blink182/Feldman that geezer from GoldFinger sound but that’s okay they know what they are doing. 
Production is more ‘modern’ the sampled harmonies are never over-done, and you can hear the finesse in the guitar work and errors in the vocals. It frankly sounds great and it even has, dare I say it, actual dynamic range other than ‘loud’. Vocally his voice has matured, but still the same three melodies.
The only real problem…I hate his lyrics, I hate them so much. So very, very much.

His words are a kind-of lyrical lrmageddon. He destroys meaning, pounds through context, disregards meanings. I cannot fathom the end game, is it words? Does he hate words? and I have to wonder is it personal? Has he been informed of a middle age keyboard warrior in the south of England that physically recoils when his cascading cock-waffle punctures my conscious?

For example `Lightbulb`, is he narrating from the first person? I always move in circles? Sick of the spins? If so why does this exquisite gem  exist?

*?? Can’t speak with my tongue caught up in my teeth…caught up in my teeth. ??*

Fuck it i'm two beers in lets, keep going:

> I’m bathing in exhaustion, <br/> 
> A neverending train wreck

It’s starts well, bathing in *exhaustion*, evocative a swampy static sensation and of weight/pressure. I’m down with that. It’s a strong start. Oh hark but what is this, the second line is suddenly a kinetic always moving act of deliberate motion.

How about this fucking mess?

` I need something symbolic to rupture` **(No you don't)<br />**
` I want to seek some unforeseen color` **(nope that does not make any sense)**

I have no idea why this guy and his weird bad yoda impression get's me so riled up. I really do like the band, I listen them most days, but it's like cathcing a finger in a drawer, or curtting a nail too short. The shock. I'll never leave you with one last gem (Which doesn't scan and is electronically altered):

> An envelope could never fix you, <br />
> but it's strange how i like to think so`
